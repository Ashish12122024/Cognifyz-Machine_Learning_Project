## Projects Included

### Level 1 Tasks

#### **Basic ML Model Development**:
- Developed supervised learning models (linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict restaurant ratings based on features like price range, votes, and cuisine.
- Evaluated models using performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

#### **Data Preprocessing for ML**:
- Applied techniques such as handling missing data, feature scaling, and categorical encoding to prepare data for machine learning models.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in the dataset before applying ML techniques.

#### **Feature Selection**:
- Implemented correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify important features in predicting restaurant performance.
  
### Level 2 Tasks

#### **Advanced Classification Models**:
- Built classification models (logistic regression, support vector machines, K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict restaurant success based on review sentiment and ratings.
- Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and cross-validation techniques to improve model accuracy.

#### **Ensemble Methods**:
- Used ensemble learning techniques such as bagging (Random Forests) and boosting (XGBoost) to improve model performance in predicting the likelihood of customer retention.
- Compared ensemble models with individual base models to demonstrate performance gains.

#### **Model Deployment**:
- Implemented a machine learning pipeline for model training, validation, and testing.
- Deployed predictive models in a cloud-based environment using Flask and Docker to provide real-time predictions for business applications.

### Level 3 Tasks

#### **Time Series Forecasting**:
- Developed a time series forecasting model using ARIMA and Prophet to predict future restaurant sales based on historical data.
- Evaluated models on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the forecasting accuracy.

#### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Sentiment Analysis**:
- Applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF, and sentiment analysis to analyze customer reviews.
- Built a sentiment classifier using Naive Bayes and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for improving customer satisfaction.

#### **Clustering and Anomaly Detection**:
- Performed K-means clustering to group similar restaurants based on features like price range, cuisine, and ratings.
- Implemented anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM) to identify outliers in the restaurant data, such as restaurants with abnormal customer behavior or extreme price ranges.
